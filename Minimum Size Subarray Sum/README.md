# Minimum Size Subarray Sum - Code Explanation

## Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

## Approach
We use the **Sliding Window** technique to efficiently find the minimal subarray length. The idea is to expand the window by moving the `right` pointer and contract the window by moving the `left` pointer whenever the sum meets or exceeds `target`.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0  # Left boundary of the window
        sum = 0   # Current sum of elements in the window
        min_length = float("inf")  # Initialize minimum length to infinity
        n = len(nums)  # Length of the input array
        
        for right in range(n):  # Right pointer expands the window
            sum += nums[right]  # Add current element to the sum
            
            while sum >= target:  # Shrink window if sum meets/exceeds target
                min_length = min(min_length, (right - left + 1))  # Update min length
                sum -= nums[left]  # Remove leftmost element
                left += 1  # Move left pointer forward
        
        return min_length if min_length < float("inf") else 0  # Return result
```

## Explanation (Line by Line)

### **Importing Required Modules**
```python
from typing import List
```
- `List` is imported from `typing` for type hinting to specify `nums` as a list of integers.

### **Class and Function Definition**
```python
class Solution:
```
- Defines a class `Solution` as per LeetCode's required format.

```python
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
```
- Defines a function `minSubArrayLen` that takes an integer `target` and a list `nums`, returning an integer (the minimum subarray length).

### **Variable Initialization**
```python
        left = 0  
```
- `left` represents the starting index of the current window.

```python
        sum = 0  
```
- `sum` stores the sum of elements within the current window.

```python
        min_length = float("inf")  
```
- `min_length` is initialized to **infinity** to store the minimum subarray length.
- We use `float("inf")` because any valid subarray length will be smaller than infinity.

```python
        n = len(nums)
```
- Stores the length of the input list `nums`.

### **Expanding the Sliding Window**
```python
        for right in range(n):
```
- Iterates through `nums` using `right` as the end index of the window.

```python
            sum += nums[right]
```
- Expands the window by adding `nums[right]` to `sum`.

### **Shrinking the Window if Sum Meets Target**
```python
            while sum >= target:
```
- If the `sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, try reducing the window size.

```python
                min_length = min(min_length, (right - left + 1))
```
- Updates `min_length` with the smallest subarray length found so far.

```python
                sum -= nums[left]
```
- Removes the leftmost element to see if we can find a smaller valid subarray.

```python
                left += 1
```
- Moves `left` forward to shrink the window.

### **Returning the Result**
```python
        return min_length if min_length < float("inf") else 0
```
- If `min_length` was updated, return it.
- If no valid subarray was found, return `0`.

## **Time and Space Complexity**
### **Time Complexity: O(n)**
- The `right` pointer iterates through `nums` once (`O(n)`).
- The `left` pointer moves at most `n` times (`O(n)`).
- Overall, the worst-case scenario is `O(2n) ≈ O(n)`.

### **Space Complexity: O(1)**
- We only use a few integer variables (`left`, `sum`, `min_length`, `n`), so the space complexity is **O(1)**.

## **Example Walkthrough**
### **Example 1**
#### Input:
```python
nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
target = 7
```
#### Steps:
1. `right=0`, sum=2 (less than 7)
2. `right=1`, sum=5 (less than 7)
3. `right=2`, sum=6 (less than 7)
4. `right=3`, sum=8 (meets target, update `min_length=4`)
5. Shrink window → `left=1`, sum=6
6. `right=4`, sum=10 (update `min_length=3`)
7. Shrink window → `left=2`, sum=9 (update `min_length=2`)
8. Shrink window → `left=3`, sum=7 (update `min_length=2`)
9. Shrink window → `left=4`, sum=4 (break loop)

#### Output:
```python
2
```

### **Example 2**
#### Input:
```python
nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
target = 11
```
#### Output:
```python
0
```

## **Summary**
- **Sliding Window Technique** dynamically adjusts window size.
- **O(n) Time Complexity** ensures efficiency for large inputs.
- **O(1) Space Complexity** minimizes extra memory usage.
- **Handles Edge Cases**, such as when no valid subarray exists.

This method provides an optimal solution for finding the minimal length subarray with sum ≥ `target`.
