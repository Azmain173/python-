### Explanation of "Same Tree" LeetCode Problem

#### Problem Statement
Given the roots of two binary trees, `p` and `q`, the goal is to determine if these trees are the same. Two trees are considered the same if they have identical structure and node values.

### Code Breakdown
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def balanced(p, q):
            if not p and not q:
                return True
            
            if (p and not q) or (q and not p):
                return False
            
            if p.val != q.val:
                return False
            
            return balanced(p.left, q.left) and balanced(p.right, q.right)
        
        return balanced(p, q)
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class Definition**
   - The `TreeNode` class represents a node in a binary tree.
   - It has three attributes:
     - `val`: The value stored in the node.
     - `left`: A reference to the left child node (if any).
     - `right`: A reference to the right child node (if any).

2. **isSameTree Method**
   - The function `isSameTree` is a method within the `Solution` class.
   - It calls the helper function `balanced` with `p` and `q` as arguments.

3. **balanced Function** (Recursive Function)
   - **Base Case 1**: If both `p` and `q` are `None`, return `True` (empty trees are identical).
   - **Base Case 2**: If one is `None` and the other is not, return `False` (structure mismatch).
   - **Base Case 3**: If the values of `p` and `q` do not match, return `False`.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - Recursively check the left subtrees using `balanced(p.left, q.left)`.
     - Recursively check the right subtrees using `balanced(p.right, q.right)`.
     - If both left and right subtrees match, return `True`.

4. **Final Return Statement**
   - The `isSameTree` method returns the result of `balanced(p, q)`, which determines if the trees are identical.

### Example Walkthrough
#### Example 1:
##### Input:
```
p:   1      q:   1
    / \        / \
   2   3      2   3
```
##### Execution Steps:
1. Compare root nodes (`1 == 1`) ✅
2. Compare left subtree (`2 == 2`) ✅
3. Compare right subtree (`3 == 3`) ✅
4. Both subtrees are identical → Return `True`

##### Output:
```
True
```

---
#### Example 2:
##### Input:
```
p:   1      q:   1
    /          \
   2            2
```
##### Execution Steps:
1. Compare root nodes (`1 == 1`) ✅
2. Compare left subtree (`p.left = 2`, `q.left = None`) ❌ → Mismatch → Return `False`

##### Output:
```
False
```

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the smaller tree (since we check each node once).
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where `H` is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack space).
  - Worst-case (unbalanced tree): O(N)
  - Best-case (balanced tree): O(log N)

---

### Summary
- We use a recursive function to compare nodes.
- If both trees are `None`, they are identical.
- If one tree is `None` and the other is not, they are different.
- If values at a node do not match, they are different.
- We recursively check left and right subtrees.
- The approach runs in O(N) time and O(H) space.

This method effectively determines if two binary trees are identical in structure and values.
